      folder_name: The `find_path` function you provided is designed to search for a folder by name
    starting from the current working directory and moving up the directory tree until it finds the
    folder or reaches the root directory.

    Returns:
      The `find_path` function is designed to search for a folder with the given `folder_name` starting
    from the current working directory (`os.getcwd()`). It iterates through the directory structure,
    checking if the folder exists in the current directory or any of its parent directories. If the

      path: The `path` parameter in the `read_doc` function is a string that represents the file path to
    the JSON document that you want to read and load. This function reads the JSON data from the file
    located at the specified path.

    Returns:
      The function `read_doc(path)` reads a JSON file located at the specified `path`, and returns the
    data loaded from the file. If there is an error reading the JSON file, it logs the error message and
    returns an empty dictionary `{}`.
